    <h2>Corned Beef and Cabbage Origins</h2>
    <p>So how did corned beef and cabbage become such a dynamic duo? It's actually an American invention. Historically, cabbage was paired with pork bacon in Ireland. Irish immigrants in 19th-century New York City, who often lived in the same neighborhood as Jewish butchers, noticed flavor similarities between the corned beef of NYC delicatessens and the pork bacon of their homeland. Thus, corned beef and cabbage was born. These days, it's commonly associated with St. Patrick's Day.</p>
